Minesweeper Kata
================

A 4 x 3 grid represents a minefield. the input is
a single method findMines() which takes the int locations of
1 or two mines as an array index from 1 to 12.

Your task is to write a program to accept this input and
produce as output a hint-field where each square is a
* for a mine or the number of adjacent mine-squares if
the square does not contain a mine. To start with The
character '*' represents a mine and the character '.'
represents no-mine.

Example output (input 1, 7):

*211
12*1
0111
